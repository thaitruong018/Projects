# Welcome to my first projects
For the purposes of practicing what I have learned, I decided to get my hand dirty with two projects:
- Predicting Boston house price with regression
- Classify Cotton leaves are diseased or fresh

**I. Predicting Boston housing prices:**    
In this project, I will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from house in Boston's suburbs.
Once I get a good fit, I will use this model to predict the monetary value of a house located at the Boston area.
The dataset used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represents aggregate information about 14 features of homes from various suburbs located in Boston
For the purpose of the project the data set 


**II. Cotton disease prediction using Deep learning:**
